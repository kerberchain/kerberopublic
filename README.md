# KERBER|OS
## FACT SHEET


### DESCRIPTION

KERBER|OS does represent a new era of blockchain and cryptocurrency focusing on transaction privacy, knowledge sharing trough sophisticated p2p AI research (free and open source) and social content and identity protection.


### FEATURES

XMSS Quantum resistant hash tree for every Wallet for efficient hacking prevention even 10 years from now. (ready)

The usual blockchain merkle tree is replaced by a unique "Genetic Tree" prediction algorithm. (ready)

Zero Knowledge Proof protocol (exchange of challenges) for authorizations and communication between wallet holders. (ready)

No external connection to VPNs or networks (such as TOR and I2P) (ready)

Strong socket encryption for all communications within the blockchain (ready)

Fast and secure transactions (in the work 50% completed)

All transaction and private data are hidden and detached unless requested by an authorized wallet holder (sender or receiver). (ready)

No block size limit (ready)

Fast P2P / DHT / RPC / JSONRPC protocols (75% completed)

Friendly HTTPS secure API (ready)

Easy to configure smart contracts, no complicated language to learn, only fill up a json file and the interpreter does the hard work. If you know python you can also include your own custom functions and declare them in the JSON file. (50% completed)

Use anonymous tracker to synchronize the chain. (ready)

Size of chain reduced considerably compared to other blockchain (ETH: Â±20GB, KERBEROS (compare to the same size) would be 200MB approximately)

250,000 Transactions per seconds / 150,000 at peak time (planned at official launch need more testing)

# KERBEROS : QUANTUM ERA BLOCKCHAIN PROVIDING ULTIMATE PRIVACY, PROTECTION, OPEN SOURCE P2P MACHINE LEARNING AND SMART CONTRACTS.


## ABSTRACT


Kerberos is the result of years of study and observations that began in 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin and from our personal experience building a decentralized social network using existing blockchain infrastructures. 

We were looking for an efficient, cost effective and fast way to store massive amounts of user's content on a decentralized platform. After a lot of research and discussions with industry developers, we realized nothing was made to suit our needs and that the fees were excessively high to make our project viable financially. 

To solve our problem we started developing KERBEROS from the ground up in November 2017. While developing we also noticed that most of the cryptocurrencies are not totally private and a lot was overlooked in their structure to make them future-proof. We are trying to solve most of those problems and fill the gaps with a new vision about how a private, decentralized blockchain should be. 


## The Problem with privacy coins (2016-2018)

### PRIVACY AND ANONYMITY - LACK OF VISION?

The main problem with privacy coins is the lack of vision in their development. Per example a lot of developers who are involved in the development of such projects decides to use existing infrastructures to insure a user 's privacy. The most notorious example is the usage of the Tor network / onion protocol. 

There is nothing bad about using the Tor protocol to insure a user identity, it can sometimes be a shortcut rather than developing their own solution and reduce the development budget. However TOR and the Onion protocol we're made for one purpose which is to be used as a decentralized VPN to give access to websites that are blocked by totalitarian countries. It did fulfill its mission well, but in our opinion is not adapted to the blockchain needs in terms of anonymity, privacy and fluidity of the transaction process.

Futhermore, it does not insure total privacy/anonymity as we have seen a couple times with website owners on the darknet being thrown in jail by the authorities.



### QUESTIONABLE MOTIVATIONS

On top of using pre-existing, old technologies, a lot of the said coins/projects offer privacy as an option and use it to hype their projects at Pre-ICO / ICO stage. Not to mention the tokens built on top of existing public blockchain who are far from being private and with a lot of security flaws. 

In our opinion this is disrespectful to the public with no technical knowledge and shows greed in the process which is the opposite of fulfilling the public good which is our top priority. 


### CHALLENGE MINIMIZATION

It is now well known that a lot of developers or businesses take their chance in the expensive ICO process hoping it would bring them large revenues quickly. More than 90% fails to deliver. This is due to taking the matter too lightly and putting patches on top of each other in hope that the "code-soup" will magically make their  project work. 

It may sound harsh but a lot of questions are failing to get answers or are minimized. Per example about Quantum computing and its effects on the viability of a wallet algorithm, or how would miner mine without knowing the transactions they confirm? No solution has been found to date that have been put to use in most project. 


### THERE IS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNEL

Not all privacy coin projects are bad, or not relevant. Some are backed by very good developers and are pioneering the privacy-coin space. For such projects we show a lot of respect and value them. Some you may want to look at are : Monero and ZCash who have both pioneered the privacy coin area with concepts such as the Zero-Knowledge proof put in practice in the zSnark library which is used widely in other projects not related to cryptocurrencies.
